Ã  la mode is a lightweight auto-update library for Java desktop applications.

PLEASE NOTE: THERE ARE NUMEROUS THINGS NOT WORKING RIGHT NOW.

DO NOT USE A LA MODE YET.

Usage is fairly simple:

1) Put your distribution files in a directory on a publicly accessible web server.
2) cd to that directory.
3) Run 'alamode_index' with the set of files and subdirectories you want included in the index.
   e.g. 'alamode_index program.jar resources assets splash.png'
5...203) Integrate UpdateService into your client program's architecture.
